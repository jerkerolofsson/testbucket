# Hybrid tests

Hybrid tests are tests that contain a script embedded in the markdown.

## Partially automated tests

By default these tests will be set to the execution type "hybrid". 
When running the tests the tester can click a "play" button to evaluate the code.

## Fully automated tests

In order to run embedded scripts automated without any interaction, the type must be changed to "hybrid-automated".

These tests will be executed on test bucket runners automatically.
